Experts, climbers and explorers in the DS - WIP
Introduction
I have done an analysis on the dataset of 2021 survey. Here is the report, if you want to read. This analysis identifies three clusters of 2021 Kaggle survey participants by k-means clustering method. By digging further of each cluster, we name them as explorers, climbers and experts, depending on how they respond questions in regards of demographics, professions, their skill and knowledge in data science, the tools they are frequently using and tools they plan to get more familiar in the next two years. In this notebook, I want to reproduce the methodology for the 2022 dataset and try to see if it fits.

Motivation
This analysis tries to answer -

How many types of professionists in the data science field?
How does each segment of data science professionsts differ in demographics, professions, their skill and knowledge in data science, the tools they are frequently using and tools they plan to get more familiar in the next two years?
